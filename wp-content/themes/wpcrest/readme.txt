A Fluid & Responsive Theme for WordPress

== Description ==

It's recommended you have the [WordPress Fields Framework](http://wordpress.org/plugins/fields-framework/ "WordPress Fields Framework") plugin installed and activated so that the theme options can be managed from the backend.

= Information =

* A multipurpose theme for WordPress which uses a fluid and responsive design. What this means is that the design will be sized according to the user's screen width. This approach is used to provide every user with an optimal viewing experience regardless of the device they are using to browse your website.

* The theme has been tested on all major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari and Chrome

* The theme features a scheme switcher using which your visitors can change the skin and background images. It provides 5 skins, 15 background underlays and 13 background overlays.

* It supports 5 custom Post Formats viz. Image, Gallery, Video, Audio and the default Standard. The administration panel provides various different options for managing custom post formats with ease.

* Posts entries are displayed on their respective archive pages using a dynamic layout

* Images and Posts entries are loaded asynchronously using AJAX so that your browser does not have to refresh the whole page

* The backend section provides administrators an ability of uploading custom logos and background images

* Provides great control from the backend system so that you won't have to go editing files. You can control all the headings, labels and other messages which you see on the frontend right from the administration area.

* I18n (Internationalization) Ready. Which means you can translate the theme to your language

* Custom Frontpage

* A Contact Page

* Search Results Page
